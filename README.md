# great-colour-game
Made as part of Web Developer Udemy Bootcamp. Web application which presents users with a randomly generated RGB colour. The user then has to click on which coloured box they think matches the RBG description. If they are incorrect, the box disappears, leaving the user with one less colour to choose from. There is a standard "hard mode" which provides 6 colours, and an easy mode which has 3 colours to choose from. Can be viewed here: https://catherinestirk97.github.io/colour-game/
